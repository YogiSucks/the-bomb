# the-bomb
a repository of random swf's of popular flash games that you can use if you're trying to use a flash emulator, or you know a thing or two about flash urls and need some for hotlinks to games.

if you want to look for a swf to try such as one of the papa louie games, you could try to look here every once in a while, along with other stuff like alien hominid.


(PS. pierre.swf is a game i made on my own, by the way.)
